# Rock Paper Scisors
This is a simple console game of Rock Paper Scisors built using python.
Not a perfect program, i just entertained myself doing this.

#How to Start
First, make sure you have the right python and pip versions:
  - Python v3.11.5 -> https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/
  - Pip v23.2.1 -> https://pypi.org/project/pip/#files

Then, click the "START.bat" file and play!
The options in a round available are "r", "p" and "s". "r" for Rock, "p" for Paper and "s" for Scisors.

Have fun!!
